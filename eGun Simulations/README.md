eGun Simulations
================
The file 'deepDive.gem' defines the geometry of the electron gun. Once the .gem file has been parsed by SIMION and the potential array is constructed, the user file 'deepDive.lua' is used to modify the various electrodes and, if desired, enable the genetic algorithm for beam optimization. To do so, simply remove the comments in each **function segment** labeled as 'genetic algorithm stuff'.
