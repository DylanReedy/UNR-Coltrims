Alt-eGun Simulations
The file 'deepDive.gem' defines the geometry of the electron gun. Once parsed by SIMION, the user file 'deepDive.lua' allows the user to the various electrodes and, if desired, enable the genetic algorithm to optimize the beam. To do so, simply remove the comments in each **function segment** labeled as 'genetic algorithm stuff'.
